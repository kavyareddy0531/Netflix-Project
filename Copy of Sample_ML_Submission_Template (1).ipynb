The dataset includes information about movies and TV shows such as content type, country of production, genre, release year, rating, and duration. The primary goal of the project is to understand content trends, identify hidden patterns, and segment similar content to support business decision-making.\n","\n","The project began with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the structure, quality, and distribution of the data. During EDA, missing values were handled, date features were processed, and visualizations were created to analyze trends such as the growth of content over the years, popular genres, dominant content-producing countries, and audience ratings. These insights helped in understanding Netflix’s focus on modern, diverse, and global content.\n","\n","Since there was no target variable available in the dataset, the problem was treated as an unsupervised learning problem. Relevant features were selected and preprocessed using encoding and scaling techniques. K-Means clustering was then applied to group similar Netflix titles into distinct clusters. Each cluster represented a specific type of content pattern, such as recent TV shows, genre-focused content, or region-specific productions.\n","\n","The outcomes of this project demonstrate how data-driven approaches can help Netflix improve content segmentation, enhance recommendation systems, and make informed decisions about future content acquisition. Overall, the project successfully combines EDA and machine learning to generate actionable business insights from real-world streaming data."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**https://github.com/kavyareddy0531/Netflix-Project**\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Netflix has a large collection of movies and TV shows with no labeled target data.
